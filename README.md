# MoonGenerator
A custom terrain generator for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers that generates terrain similar to the Moon's surface. Inspired by Dinnerbone's creation "BukkitFullOfMoon", an example of Bukkit's terrain generation features.

Currently works on Spigot 1.17.1! To create a moon world with Multiverse (recommended), just type `/mv create moon normal -g MoonGenerator`

Generation at the moment is quite basic, it generates terrain with craters and occasionally flags. Customization is available in the config. Flags are currently not qorking quite right. Ores and moon bases/rockets are next on the list for generated objects.
